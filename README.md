## Button Click Delay Experiment

This is a dead-simple self-experiment inspired by [this research article](<https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(06)00627-1>), which explores how users respond to gradually increasing delays between an action and feedback. The researchers found that participants adapted to delays between actions and feedback over time, and once the simulated delay was reset, perceived the feedback as occurring before the action itself (Stetson et al., 2006).
